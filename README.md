# Stock-Predictor-CLI
The project aims to search different stock names, and their prices and also predict their prices for the next 4-5 days. 

The repository contains 2 files stockCLI.py and stockMain.py.

You can run either of those in your command prompt by command 'python <name-of-file>.py'

It is recommended to run stockCLI.py as it will add all the necessary libraries needed to run these files.
